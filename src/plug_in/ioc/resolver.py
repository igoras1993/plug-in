        Advances internal resolver state to the point that no further advances
        are possible at this time. Keeping resolver in the most recent state
        improves call-time performance.

        You can safely use this method whenever you want. It is also a reasonable
        routine to [eventually] call this whenever all Your managed objects and
        managing subjects are ready.

        You can control the exception raising behavior with `assert_resolver_ready`.
        Setting it to `True` will raise one of three exceptions that should be
        cached by caller:

        - [.UnexpectedForwardRefError][]
        - [.MissingMountError][]
        - [.MissingPluginError][]

        When this flag is set to `False` (default), those exceptions are silenced
        and resolver is kept at the most possible recent state.
        Above exceptions are caused by not finished plugin setup and will likely
        vanish at the application startup time.

        If they are not vanishing, this means that `plug_in` is unable to resolve
        some symbols (e.g. when they are used via `if TYPE_CHECKING: import ...`)
        or `plug_in` registry/router configuration is incorrect.

        Raises:
            [.UnexpectedForwardRefError][]: Only of assert flag is set
            [.MissingMountError][]: Only of assert flag is set
            [.MissingPluginError][]: Only of assert flag is set
            [.ObjectNotSupported][]: Always when callable is not supported by
                a `plug_in`
            [.EmptyHostAnnotationError][]: Always when callable parameter marked
                by a [.HostedMark][] has no annotation.
            [.InvalidHostSubject][]: Always when callable parameter marked by a
                [.HostMark][] is annotated with object which is not a valid type.
